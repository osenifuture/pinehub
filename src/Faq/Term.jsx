      </h3>
      <p>
        ‍Nigeria Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The
        Light" law, permits consumers who are California residents, to request
        and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the
        categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light
        law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third
        parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. Our
        disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumers’ personal
        information with third parties for them to directly market their own
        products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own
        business. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a
        request, contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.

      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable

        information or social security number. You may, however, visit our site
        anonymously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most websites, we use cookies and/or web beacons to enhance your
        experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to our
        website. Please refer to the 'do we use cookies?' section below for
        information about cookies and how we use them.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Sources of Personal Information.</h3>
      <p>
        ‍We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the
        following categories of sources:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Directly from you. For example, during account registration from forms
        you complete, subscriptions you purchase or comments you provide on our
        Websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Indirectly from you. For example, from observing your actions on our
        Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        - From third parties. For example, third party social networking
        providers and advertising companies, our affiliates and service
        providers who provide services or information to us. If you do not want
        us to collect information from social networks, you should review and
        adjust your privacy settings on those networks as desired before linking
        or connecting them to our Websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        - From publicly available sources. For example, online database
        searches.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Use and Disclosure ("Sale") of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        ‍We may have "sold" (as that term is defined in the CCPA) Personal
        Information in the following categories from consumers within the last
        twelve (12) months. Please note that the CCPA uses an expanded
        definition of the term, in which "sell" means:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making
        available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing,
        or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by
        the business to a third party for valuable consideration; or (B) sharing
        orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's
        personal information with a third party, whether for valuable
        consideration or for no consideration, for the third party's commercial
        purposes."
      </p>
      <p>
        When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means
        that we may have received some kind of benefit to our Pine-Hub in return
        for sharing Personal Information, but not necessarily received any money
        in exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        The categories below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean
        that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact
        "sold" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge
        that some of that information may have been shared for value in return.
        We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal
        Information "sold," we will investigate and provide an individualized
        response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our
        general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response
        would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses
        all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such
        a consumer request.

        formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a fee to process or
        respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
        repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request

      <h3>‍8.3 Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights</h3>
      <p>
        ‍We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
        rights. In particular, we will not:
      </p>
      <p>- Deny you goods or services</p>
      <p>
        - Charge you different prices for goods or services, whether through
        denying benefits or imposing penalties
      </p>
      <p>
        - Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services
      </p>
      <p>- Threaten you with any of the above</p>
      <p>
        However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the
        CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any
        CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to
        your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that
        describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial
        incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may
        revoke at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently do not offer any financial incentive, benefit, or price
        differences in return for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of Personal
        Information. However, in general, our business model is based on
        providing a certain amount of monthly free content to readers, after
        which we may require that additional content access must be paid for. On
        some of our Websites and apps, this content may be paid for either
        through the delivery of advertisements, or through subscriptions. On
        those Websites and apps, consumers who use ad-blocking technology will
        be notified of the option to turn off the ad blocking or to pay for a
        subscription to access the content. On some other Websites and apps,
        content must be paid for after a certain number of monthly free
        articles, whether advertising is present or not.
      </p>
      <h3>‍Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</h3>
      <p>
        ‍The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can
        opt out of the ''sale" of their Personal Information. The link to our Do
        Not Sell web form is located here.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‍ In addition, you may opt out of certain interest-based advertising by
        using the following resources:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) You may opt-out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on
        your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other

      <h3>‍How do we protect your information? </h3>
      <p>
        ‍We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
        your personal information when you place an order or access your
        personal information. Protecting the security of your personal
        information is very important to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
        information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and
        then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be
        accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such
        systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. All
        transactions are processed through a third party via SSL API. We do not
        store date OF ANY KIND on this website with exception to the fields
        noted herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social
        security numbers, financials, etc.) will be kept on file for more than
        60 days in order to facilitate future orders as some customers maintain
        ongoing, monthly purchasing transactions with Pine-Hub.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you register with us, your online account information is protected by
        a password chosen by you. The site does not store plaintext
        (human-readable) passwords, nor does it store encrypted
        (computerdecryptable) passwords. Alternatively, this site uses password
        hashes and if exposed/compromised, can not reveal your human-readable
        password. This is to help limit any further use of your password on
        unrelated sites. Access to that online account requires your username
        and password. We recommend that you do not disclose your username and
        password to any other person. To prevent unauthorized access or
        disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of
        information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and
        managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
        online. We use the latest in encryption technology when collecting or
        transferring sensitive data, such as credit card and bank account
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When registering for access to a secure area of the Site, we will ask
        you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not
        divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password
        in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember
        to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when
        you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access
        your personal information and correspondence when accessing your
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use commercially reasonable procedures and various technical,
        administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the
        confidentiality of Personal Information. However, no data transmitted
        over the Internet or stored or maintained by us or our third-party
        service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication
        via technology systems. Therefore, although we believe the measures
        implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood
        of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data
        involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect,
        that your Personal Information or private communications sent to us over
        those systems will always remain private or secure. We are not
        responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security
        features.
