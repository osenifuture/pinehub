        <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which
          are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or
          smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the
          website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the same
          cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited
          them before.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how the
          Site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently,

        <h3>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</h3>
        <p>
          The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into
          one of six categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality,
          Flash, Tailored Content and Targeting. In order to provide you with
          the best browsing experience, CloudFi uses the cookies from all of the
          above-mentioned categories on the Site. You can find out more about
          each cookie category in the sections below.
        </p>
        <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the
          Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without
          these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment
          submission can’t be provided.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for
          example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages
          from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that
          identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and
          is only used to improve how the Site works.
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as
          your user name, language or the region you’re in). For instance, the
          Site uses functionality cookies to remember your region preference.
          These cookies can also be used to remember changes you’ve made to text
          size, font and other parts of pages that you can customize. The
          information these cookies collect may be anonymous and they cannot
          track your browsing activity on other websites.
        </p>
        <h3>Flash Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver
          special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your
          user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as "Flash
          cookies") are employed to provide functions such as remembering your
          settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but
          they are managed through an interface different from the one provided
          by your web browser. This means it is not possible to manage Flash
          cookies through your browser in the same way you would normally manage
          cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from
          Adobe’s website at

        <h3>Tailored Content Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          Tailored content cookies help the Site provide enhanced features and
          display content in a way that is relevant to you. These cookies help
          the Site determine what information to show you based on how you have
          used the Site previously. These cookies do not track your browsing
          activity on other websites.
        </p>
        <h3>Targeting Cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more
          relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
          number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
          effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They remember that you have
          visited a website and this information may be shared with other
          organizations such as advertisers. This means after you have been to
          the Site you may see some advertisements about our services elsewhere
          on the Internet.
        </p>
        <h3>HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</h3>
        <p>
          The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends
          on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies
          will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent
          cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.
        </p>
        <h3>FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</h3>
        <p>
          First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third party
          cookies are cookies that another party places on your browsing device
          through our Site. For example, third party website will place a cookie
          on your browsing device if you click on such third-party website link
          when browsing the Site.
